I started off by making a simple neural network with 1 convolution layer, 1 pooling layer, 1 hidden layer and an output layer. However, this led to a pretty inefficient model which I suppose is due to the limited size and its inability to detect complex features. I then simply added more layers into my neural network to allow it to detect more complex features. This along with increasing the number of neurons in each layer significantly brouhgt up the accuracy of the model. I added more convolution and pooling layers which initially brought up the accuraccy but brought it down beyond just 2 of each. I also noticed that adding more pooling layers reduced the computation time but also resulted in a drop in accuraccy when done excessively. I also played around with the activation function of the output layer and found that the softmax function worked the best
At the end I was able to find that 2 convolution and pooling layers with 3 hidden layers worked the best. Reducing the droupout rate also significantly improved the accuracy of the model
